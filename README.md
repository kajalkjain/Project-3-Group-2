# Project-3-Group-2

## Healthcare

**A Short Project Proposal**

The main aim of our project is to provide insights into trends, costs and the outcomes within the healthcare industry, potentially helping healthcare providers, policymakers and patients to make more informed decisions.

## Project Title 
**Data Visualisation Track**

## Project Objective

To predict medical test results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive) using synthetic data. The objective of the project is to improve understanding of predictive modelling in healthcare through data manipulation, feature engineering, and model training. Additionally, it will explore trends in patient demographics, cost analysis, and common conditions. By bridging data insights with practical healthcare applications, this project will provide valuable information for healthcare providers, policymakers, and patients, leading to better decision-making, optimised costs, and improved patient outcomes.

**Scope and Research Questions**

- What is the distribution of medical conditions among different age groups?

  Visualization: Bar chart or pie chart.(Jess)

- How do billing amounts vary across different medical conditions?

  Visualization: Box plot or bar chart.(Napat)

- What are the proportions of different admission types (Emergency, Elective, Urgent)?

  Visualization: Pie chart or bar chart.(Jess)

- How do test results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive) vary by medical condition?

## Data Source

We sourced our data from kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset 

## Data Ethics

We acknowledge the importance of healthcare data privacy and security and emphasise that this dataset is entirely synthetic. It does not contain any real patient information or violate any privacy regulations (This data has been generated using Python's Faker library to mimic real healthcare records, enabling safe learning and experimentation in healthcare analytics.)

## Visualisation Types

Histograms, Bar charts, Pie charts to visualise the proportion of different admission types (Emergency, Elective, Urgent).
Heatmaps to explore correlations between features like age, billing amount, and test results.
Box plots to compare billing amounts across different medical conditions.
Regression plots to analyse the relationship between variables such as age and billing amount, or between medical conditions and test results.

**Tools and Technologies**

  
  - **Python Pandas** For data cleaning,transforming and analysis
  
  - **PostgreSQL** To store and extra data(Napat gentle reminder to work on this)
  
  - **Data Visualisation** Python (Matplotlib(bar charts, pie charts),Pandas plotting, hvplot)
                         Seaborn: Providing a more visually appealing and informative set of default styles and colour palettes.
                         Jupyter Notebook: To interactively explore and analyse data

## Expected Outcomes
- **Goal:** To provide clear insights into how different features impact the prediction of medical test results.

- **How:** Data visualisations such as bar charts, Line plots and scatter plots will be created to explore the distribution of features and their relationships with test results.
the frequency of each medical condition in the dataset, giving an overview of the most common health issues.
average number of days patients stay in the hospital for each medical condition, helping us understand which conditions typically require longer hospital stays.
the market share of different insurance providers among the patients in the dataset.

- **To Target Audience:** Helps healthcare professionals and data scientists understand which factors are most influential in predicting test results, leading to more transparent and interpretable models. Helps inform feature engineering and model development strategies
