# Project-3-Group-2
Healthcare

**Goal and objective**
The aim of our project is to provide insights into trends, costs and outcomes within the healthcare industry, potentially helping healthcare providers, policymakers, Health Insurance providers and patients to make more informed decisions .
Patient Demographics: How age, gender, and blood type relate to different medical conditions.
Cost Analysis: How much different medical conditions cost and which age groups are affected the most.
Common Conditions: What medical issues are most common in different age groups and how they impact costs.


**Data Source :**
We sourced our data from kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset 


**Various Data Visualisations**
How: Data visualisations such as bar charts, Line plots and scatter plots will be created to explore the distribution of features and their relationships with test results.
    the frequency of each medical condition in the dataset, giving an overview of the most common health issues.
    average number of days patients stay in the hospital for each medical condition, helping us understand which conditions typically require longer hospital stays.
    the market share of different insurance providers among the patients in the dataset.


NOTE: We acknowledge the importance of healthcare data privacy and security and emphasise that this dataset is entirely synthetic. It does not contain any real patient information or violate any privacy regulations (This data has been generated using Python's Faker library to mimic real healthcare records, enabling safe learning and experimentation in healthcare analytics.)
